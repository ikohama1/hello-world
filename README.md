# hello-world

HI my name is Issei Kohama

I recently graduated from SUNy @ Binghamton w/ BA in Physics
I currently am learning programming, especially python, R, and SQL
and also trying to do independent projects for fun to see how powerful data can be used 
to see what is actually going on and possibly what we can do about it in the future
